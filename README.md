- 👋 Hi, I’m @zaltark. Im just your average gamer/IT guy. I never really touched Linux much in the past, but since being fired from my IT job I've had some time to learn. Also I've come to like the idea of FOSS.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Linux! Specifically learning how it works and becoming apart of the community.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... General Fedora/CentOS
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything!
  
- 📫 How to reach me ... Discord would be best probably.  - zaltark
