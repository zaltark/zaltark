- 👋 Hi, I’m @zaltark. Im just your average gamer/IT guy. I never really touched Linux much in the past, but since being fired from my IT job I've had some time to learn. Also I've come to like the idea of FOSS.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Linux! Specifically learning how it works and becoming apart of the community.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Flatpaks! I did the tutorial for Snaps too, but I think Flatpaks are better.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything related to flatpaks! And Fedora. And Gaming! I need Linux to become a pro gaming system.
  
- 📫 How to reach me ... Discord would be best probably.  - zaltark
